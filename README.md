# MiscCpp

A couple random C/C++ programs from projects I've worked on.

_ftpd.cpp_ : A simple FTP-like background service to support file
            listings and download via a web-browser through a
            non-standard port.

_dosdisk.c_ : A file-system disk reader for accessing DOS disks from
              Unix/Solaris.  Back then (~2002) DOS disks weren't
              supported, so I put together a utility to navagate and
              read files from my floppies.
